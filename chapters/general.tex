\chapter{General stuff}





\section{Use version control}

Use some kind of sensible version control for your code.
The author uses Git but has also heard good things about Mercurial.
Sending the code to yourself on facebook is not a proper system for version control.





\section{Use \hologo{LuaLaTeX} or \hologo{XeLaTeX}}

Use {\LuaLaTeX} or {\XeLaTeX} for native unicode support (i.e.\ without including any kind of additional packages).
The author recommends {\LuaLaTeX} because the \texttt{microtype} package his only a limited functionality under {\XeLaTeX}.





\section{Use the KOMA classes}

Instead of the standard classes \texttt{article}, \texttt{report} and \texttt{book} use the more modern KOMA-Script classes \texttt{scrartcl}, \texttt{scrreprt} and \texttt{scrbook}.
They provide more functionalities then the standard classes.

The look of headings in these classes can be adjusted to be as for the standard classes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Passing the option~\inlinecode{chapterprefix~=~true} to~\commandname{documentclass} will make ensure that the text~\enquote{Chapter \{number of chapter\}} will be printed at the beginning of a new chapter, atop of the chapter name.
    \begin{showcode}{Using~\inlinecode{chapterprefix~=~true}}
\documentclass[a4paper, 10pt, chapterprefix = true]{scrbook}
    \end{showcode}
  \item
    The font for headings and items of description environments can be changed back to the standard font of the document by adding the following to the preamble:
    \begin{showcode}{Canging from KOMA fonts back to standard font}
\setkomafont{disposition}{\normalfont\bfseries}
\setkomafont{descriptionlabel}{\normalfont\bfseries}
    \end{showcode}
\end{itemize}





\section{Use the correct document class}

The three standard classes to consider for a mathematical project are~\inlinecode{scrartcl},~\inlinecode{scrreprt} and~\inlinecode{scrbook}.
These three classes differ in what functionalities they provide and what they standard settings are.

The class~\inlinecode{scrartcl} is the most basic one.
It provides the standard sectioning commands~\commandname{section},~\commandname{subsection} and~\commandname{subsubsection}.
An abstract can be set with the~\envname{abstract} environment and by giving~\commandname{documentclass} the option~\inlinecode{abstract~=~on}.

The class~\inlinecode{scrreprt} extends the previous class:
It provides the additional sectioning command~\commandname{chapter} that precedes~\commandname{section}.
The title is now printed its own page.
It also provides the sectioning command~\commandname{abstract} after which all chapters will be counted towards the appendix.
The~\envname{abstract} environment is still available in the same way as before.
(But the abstract is printed only on the second page, after the title page.)

The class~\inlinecode{scrbook} provides the additional sectioning command~\commandname{part} that precedes~\commandname{chapter}.
This class also provides the (very useful) additional sectioning commands~\commandname{frontmatter},~\commandname{mainmatter} and~\commandname{backmatter}.
The~\envname{abstract} environment isnâ€™t available anymore.
This class distinguish between left and right pages, i.e.\ even and odd pages.
The chapters begin on right pages.

In praxis one should use the class~\inlinecode{scrartcl} if only sections and subsections are used, and otherwise the class~\inlinecode{scrbook}.
Instead of~\inlinecode{scrreprt} one should directly use~\inlinecode{scrbook}:
The additional commands~\commandname{frontmatter},~\commandname{mainmatter} and~\commandname{backmatter} that~\inlinecode{scrbook} provides are extremly useful (see \cref{using frontmatter}), and the visual difference between~\inlinecode{scrreprt} and~\inlinecode{scrbook} (which is their main difference) can easily be adjusted by passing the option~\inlinecode{openany} to~\commandname{documentclass}.





\section{Use \texttt{{\tbs}frontmatter} and friends}
\label{using frontmatter}

The class~\inlinecode{scrbook} provides the commands~\commandname{frontmatter},~\commandname{mainmatter} and\commandname{backmatter}.
Together with~\commandname{appendix} these can be used to separate the separate the document into four parts:
The front part, the main part, the appendix and the back part.
These parts behave slighty differently:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    The front part uses lower case roman numerals for page numbers.
    In the generated pdf-file these pages will again be numbered with roman numerals (this will be important for the main part).
    Chapters in this part of the document will not be numbered, but will appear in the table of contents.
    
    This part of the document should include the title page, preface, table of content and introduction.
    Basically everything that occurs before the first chapter.
  \item
    The main part uses arabic numerals for page numbers and the page number is reset when the main part starts.
    The first page of the main part is therefore numbered~\enquote{1}.
    In the generated pdf-file this first page will also be numbered as such.
    This means that going to page~15 of the pdf-file will indeed give page~15 of the document.
    The chapters in this part of the document are numbered and appear in the table of contents.
    
    This part of the document does contain the vast amount of the document.
    It contains all the chapters excluding the ones belonging into the appendix.
  \item
    The appendix part continues the numbering of the main part.
    It both resets the chapter number and changes its style to upper case letters.
    The first chapter in this part wil hence be numbered~\enquote{A}.
    If the option~\inlinecode{chapterprefix~=~true} is set then the word~\enquote{Chapter} at the beginning of a new~\commandname{chapter} will be replaced by~\enquote{Appendix}.
    
    This part of the document should contain all appendices.
  \item
    The back part continues the numbering of the appendix (and thus the numbering of the main part).
    The chapters appearing in this part of the document are again unnumbered, and no~\enquote{Chapter} is printed at the beginning of a new~\commandname{chapter} is printed.
    
    This part of the document should contain the bibliography and the index.
    An entry for the bibliography can be added to the table of contents by passing the option~\inlinecode{bibliography~=~totocnumbered} to the~\commandname{documentclass}.
\end{itemize}

The document lyaout with~\inlinecode{scrbook} should therofer look roughly as follows:

\begin{showcode}{General document layout with~\inlinecode{scrbook}}
\documentclass[a4paper, 10pt,bibliography=totocnumbered]{scrbook}

% preamble

\begin{document}

\frontmatter
\maketitle
% dedication
% preface
\tableofcontents
% introduction

\mainmatter
% most of the document

\appendix
% the appendices

\backmatter
\printbibliography
% index
\end{document}
\end{showcode}






\section{Split up your project in files}

Any slighty larger project should be split up into multiple files.
There are (at least) three useful ways to include another file into your project: \commandtt{usepackage}, \commandtt{include} and \commandtt{input}.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item
    Most of the preamble informations -- including of packages, configuration of syles, configuration of the look and feels of the document -- should be put into one or multiple \texttt{.sty} files.
    These file(s) can then be included into the document by using \commandtt{usepackage}.
  \item
    The commands \commandtt{include} and \commandtt{input} insert the text of the specified documents at the position where they are used, but have slight differences:
    \begin{itemize}[label = \textopenbullet, leftmargin=*]
      \item
        The \commandtt{include} command ensures that the included content starts on a new page, and also that the following content begines on a new page.
        The \commandtt{input} simply inserts the included content at the given position without any such additional formatting.
      \item
        Multiple uses of \commandtt{include} cannot be nested, i.e.\ an included file cannot contain the \commandtt{include} command again.
        The \commandtt{input} command on the other hand can be nested.
        
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

One should use the \commandtt{include} command for chapters and the \commandtt{input} command for any smaller level of text organization.
One should break the main text into smaller units until the resulting files have a sensible length.

Suppose for example that your text consists of three chapters, each of which consists of two sections.
Then you should have at least ten files:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    A master file \texttt{main.tex}.
    This file includes all other files in some way, and this is the file which needs to be compiled.
  \item
    A file \texttt{mystyle.sty} in which packages are included and options are set.
  \item
    Three files like \texttt{chapter1.tex}, \texttt{chapter2.tex} and \texttt{chapter3.tex} for the chapters.
  \item
    Sixes files for the sections, say \texttt{section1.tex} up to \texttt{section6.tex}.
\end{itemize}
These files should include each other as shown in \cref{file inclusion structure}.
\begin{figure}[tb]
  \begin{center}
    % the following diagram uses the "trees" library
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      every node/.style = {shape=rectangle, rounded corners, draw, align=center},
      level 1/.style = {sibling distance = 15em},
      level 2/.style = {sibling distance = 5em}
      ]
      \node {\texttt{main}}
        child { node [right=3em] {\texttt{mystyle}} }
        child { node {\texttt{chapter1}}
          child { node {\texttt{section1}} }
          child { node {\texttt{section2}} }
          child { node {\texttt{section3}} }
        }
        child { node {\texttt{chapter2}}
          child { node {\texttt{section4}} }
          child { node {\texttt{section5}} }
          child { node {\texttt{section6}} }
        };
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Splitting up a file.}
  \label{file inclusion structure}
\end{figure}
We suppose for simplity that all ten files are contained in the same directory.
The master file \texttt{main.tex} should look roughly as follows:
%
\begin{showcode}{Layout of \texttt{main.tex}}
\documentclass[a4paper, 10pt]{scrreprt}

\usepackage{mystyle}

\title{A Report}
\author{John Doe}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\include{chapter1}
\include{chapter2}

\end{document}
\end{showcode}
%
The file \texttt{mystyle.sty} may look as follows:
%
\begin{showcode}{Layout of \texttt{mystyle.sty}}
%%%%% PACKAGES

% general mathematics
\usepackage{mathtools}
\usepackage{amssymb}

% commutative diagrams
\usepackage{tikz-cd}

%%%%% NEW COMMANDS

% new operators
\DeclareMathOperator{\End}{End}
\DeclareMathOperator{\Hom}{Hom}
\end{showcode}
%
The file \texttt{chapter1.tex} should look roughly as follows:
%
\begin{showcode}{Layout of \texttt{chapter1.tex}}
\chapter{Name of the first chapter}

Some introduction to this chapter before the first section appears.

\input{section1}
\input{section2}
\end{showcode}
%
The file \texttt{section1.tex} should look roughly as follows:
%
\begin{showcode}{Layout of \texttt{section1.tex}}
\section{Name of the first section}

Text of the first section.
\end{showcode}





\section{Use \commandtt{includeonly}}

As a document grows so does the time that is needed to compile it.
It is therefore often desirable to compile only certain parts of the document.
One naive solution to this problem is to simply not include the currently unwanted parts, e.g.\ by commenting out the corresponding lines of \commandtt{include} and \commandtt{input}.
This approach has the problem that references to the now-excluded parts of the document will not compile properly.
This problem can be fixed by using the command \commandtt{inlude}.

Suppose that your main document, say \texttt{main.tex}, included two other files, say \texttt{chapter1.tex} and \texttt{chapter2.tex}, via the command \commandtt{include}.
Hence the file \texttt{main.tex} should look roughly as follows:
\begin{showcode}{Basic example of \texttt{master.tex}}
\documentclass[a4paper, 10pt]{scrreprt}

\begin{document}

\include{chapter1}
\include{chapter2}

\end{document}
\end{showcode}
By putting \commandtt{includeonly\{chapter1\}} before the document begins we tell {\LaTeX} to only compile this specific chapter.
\begin{showcode}{Using \commandtt{includeonly}}
\documentclass[a4paper, 10pt]{scrreprt}

\includeonly{chapter1}
\begin{document}

\include{chapter1}
\include{chapter2}

\end{document}
\end{showcode}
If in the above situation chapter~1 contains some references to chapter~2 then these references will still compile correctly, even though only chapter~1 is compiled.

The command \commandname{includeonly} has two quirks, which follow from the way {\LaTeX} handels referencing:

When {\LaTeX} compiles the file \filename{main.tex} an auxiliary file named \filename{main.aux} is created.
This file contains various information about the compiled document.
It does in particular contain a list of all labels found in \filename{main.tex} during the compilation process.
The next compilation process can then access these informations to properly properly typeset all references that refer to these labels.

A feature of the command \commandname{include} (which the command \commandname{input} does not have) is that such an auxiliary file is created for each of of the included files.
So in the above example the files \filename{chapter1.aux} and \filename{chapter2.aux} will be created.
These files will in particular contain lists of all the labels found in the files \filename{chapter1.tex} and \filename{chapter2.tex}.
This allows {\LaTeX} to access the labels in chapter~2 even though only chapter~1 is compiled.

The auxiliary file \filename{chapter2.aux} remains unchanged because {\LaTeX} does not go trough the file \filename{chapter2.tex} as long as \inlinecode{{\tbs}includeonly\{chapter1\}} is used.
This leads to the two quirks mentioned above:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Before inserting the code \inlinecode{{\tbs}includeonly\{chapter1\}} one needs to compile the whole document, including chapter~2, a least once.
    This needs to be done so that {\LaTeX} can properly create the auxiliary file \filename{chapter2.aux}.
  \item
    Changes made to \filename{chapter2.tex} will not be noticed by {\LaTeX} while the code \inlinecode{{\tbs}includeonly\{chapter1\}} is present.
    This means in particular that {\LaTeX} wonâ€™t notice any new labels that are added in this file.
    In this case one need to include \filename{chapter1.tex} for at least on compilation process to ensure that the auxiliary file \filename{chapter2.aux} is refreshed.
\end{itemize}

The command \commandname{includeonly} actually accepts as its argument a list of files to be included:
\begin{showcode}{Syntax of \commandname{includeonly}}
  \includeonly{file_1, ..., file_n}
\end{showcode}




\section{Make use of whitespace to organize the code}

{\LaTeX} almost never cares about unnecessary white space in your code.
Use generous amounts of whitespace to organize your code in a sensible way.
Donâ€™t do the following:
\begin{showcode}{Code is too cramped}
\[\begin{pmatrix*}[r]a^2+b^2&a^2-b^2\\-a^2+b^2&-a^2-b^2\end{pmatrix*}\]
\end{showcode}
Instead do the following:
\begin{showcode}{Code is less cramped}
\[
  \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
     a^2 + b^2 &  a^2 - b^2 \\
    -a^2 + b^2 & -a^2 - b^2
  \end{pmatrix*}
\]
\end{showcode}
You can (and should) even do the following:
\begin{showcode}{Code isnâ€™t cramped}
\[
  \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
    a^2 + b^2
    &
    a^2 - b^2
    \\
    - a^2 + b^2
    &
    - a^2 - b^2
  \end{pmatrix*}
\]
\end{showcode}
This last one is easiest to write and easiest to navigate.

Also put at least one space between any two symbols that do not belong together.
Donâ€™t do the following:
\begin{showcode}{Unrelated symbols need to be separated}
$y=\sin(x)-e^x$
\end{showcode}
Instead do the following:
\begin{showcode}{Unrelated symbols are separated}
$y = \sin(x) - e^x$
\end{showcode}
One could (and probably should) go even further and do the following:
\begin{showcode}{Unrelated symbols are separated even better}
$y = \sin ( x ) - e^x$
\end{showcode}





\section{Write one sentence per line}

Related the previous point, write at most one sentence per line.
This has at least three advantages:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    When an error or warning occurs {\LaTeX} will (try to) tell you the line of source code in which the problem occurs.
    Having your source code split up over multiple lines makes it much easier to find the problem.
  \item
    Organizing the source code in lines will in most cases make the tools provided by your version control system (like Git) more efficient to use.
  \item
    By writing one sentence per line you will more easily spot sentences which are overly long.
\end{itemize}





\section{Properly indent your source code}

Writing {\LaTeX} means writing source code.
Make sure that your source code is properly indented.





\section{Donâ€™t ignore warnings}

There are two ways in which {\LaTeX} will tell you that something went wrong:
Errors and warnings.

The occurence of an error means that {\LaTeX} was unable the process the source code and gave up at some point in the process.
In the case of a warning {\LaTeX} again wasnâ€™t able to process the source code, but decided to produce some output nevertheless.
Hence the only difference between an error and a warning is how {\LaTeX} decided to proceed with it.
But there is no intrinsic difference between the two of them.

It is typically hard to ignore errors, as no output file will be generated.
But warnings also shouldnâ€™t be ignored:
While the occurance of an error means that you get no outupt at all, the occurance of a warning means that youâ€™re getting a faulty output.

% TODO: Too many warnings make future problems worse.





\section{Use \texttt{\%} for problematic line~breaks}

Sometimes a sesible line break in your source code can lead to unwanted effects in the resulting output.
Consider the following example:
\begin{showlatex}*{Wrong spacing before a footnote}
Here is some text.
\footnote{Here is a footnote for this text.}
\end{showlatex}
Note the unwanted space between the period and the superscript of the footnote.
This unwanted space comes from the line break that occurs between them in the source code.
By ending the first line with \texttt{\%} we can \enquote{comment out} this line break.
We hence do the following:
\begin{showlatex}*{Right spacing before a footnote}
Here is some text.%
\footnote{Here is a footnote for this text.}
\end{showlatex}





\section{Be consistent}

One of the most important aspects of both mathematical writing and the use of mathematical notation is consistency.
If youâ€™re making crappy choices then at least do them consistently, in the same way.
Consider the following example:
% 
% \begin{tcblisting}{title = {Bad}}
% % in the preamble:
% \newcommand{\glie}{\mathfrak{g}}
% % in the main text:
% The algebra $U(\glie)$ is commutative if and only if the original Lie algebra $\glie$ is abelian.
% But $\operatorname{U}(\glie)$ is infinite dimensional whenever $\glie$ is nonzero, even if $\glie$ itself is finite dimensional as well.
% \end{tcblisting}
% Even if the reader doesnâ€™t care if you use $U(\mathfrak{g})$ or $\operatorname{U}(\mathfrak{g})$ they will notice the inconsistent use of the two notations, and this will distract them from the actual content of the text.
% 
% We consider another example:
\begin{showlatex}{Inconsistency looks bad}
If $X$ and $Y$ are two objects in a category $\mathcal{C}$ then it may happen that the set $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)$ is empty even though the set $Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(Y,X)$ is non-empty.
\end{showlatex}
The inconsistent use of~$Hom$ and~$\operatorname{Hom}$ makes the already bad~$Hom$ even worse.
